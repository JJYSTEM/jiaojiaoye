Now a PhD at the University of Oxford, obtained my Bachelor's from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 

## ðŸš€ Research interest

My research wish is to build a robust, fully automated system ðŸ¤– with learning-based methods in the challenging and uncertain real-world. Particularly, I am keen to conduct research in the interdisciplinary area of Embodied Agents and Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for precise robotic perception and decision-making in a 3D complicated and non-stationary environment.

My research interest is located in the following areas:

* Generative Model
* Embodied AI
* World Model Learning
